# Calculator Project
This project aimed to implement a calculator in Python and make it accessible via the web using the Flask framework.

##Addition Route:
localhost /+/3/5
The result is displayed automatically.

##Subtraction Route:
localhost /-/3/5
The result is displayed automatically.

##Multiplication Route:
localhost /*/3/5
The result is displayed automatically.

##Division Route:
localhost //3/5
The result is displayed automatically.

##Main Route:
The result is displayed on the main page.

###Methodology
We followed the Scrum Agile Methodology, breaking the project into two sprints:

##Sprint 1: Backend Development
Duration: 2 days
Tasks:
Developed the backend using Flask.
Implemented multiple routes to handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Results were returned in JSON format.
Conducted tests on the backend functionalities.
Review:
In the review meeting, we decided to add the frontend in the second sprint.
##Sprint 2: Frontend Development
Duration: 2 days
Tasks:
Developed the frontend using HTML and CSS.
Linked the frontend with the backend routes developed in Sprint 1.
Tested the web application in Linux and Windows environments.
#Review:
In the final review meeting, all members accepted the solution. The application was then merged and deployed for public use.
Deployment
The web-based calculator was deployed successfully, making it accessible to multiple users.
